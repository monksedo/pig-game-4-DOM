# ROLL THE DICE GAME

JavaScript assignment - The objective is to create a roll the dice game app in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## GAME RULES

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result  get added to his/her ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
